### Project 1: Global disease & mortality - Analysis of 30 years of Indonesia's data
## Context
Global healthcare expenditure has steadily increased, with countries allocating substantial portions (5â€“12%) of their GDP to healthcare (IPSOS, 2023 & IHME, 2013). Like many other nations, Indonesia faces the challenge of balancing rising healthcare costs with effective public health interventions. Indonesia's healthcare budget is projected to increase by 8.1% in 2024, reaching IDR 184.6 trillion compared to the previous year (Indonesia's Ministry of Health, 2023).

However, questions arise: Has rising healthcare expenditure improved the population health of the nation? Is the allocation of funding for healthcare and public health in line with objectives and priorities? Are there alternative metrics to guide better decisions?

It's difficult to answer these questions directly.  However, insights might be found by examining global mortality data, as these data potentially represent population health. Interestingly, the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, led by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), quantifies health loss due to diseases, injuries, and risk factors worldwide. By analyzing global mortality trends, we can obtain useful insights into the factors and dominant causes of mortality. This is crucial for the Indonesian government in prioritizing funding and formulating evidence-based policies. Additionally, the healthcare industry can gain insights from these trends to identify opportunities for providing solutions.

## Questions
Through this data analysis project, we aim to answer the following question:  What are the key insights and recommendations that can be obtained from global mortality cause data to improve the population health of Indonesia?
